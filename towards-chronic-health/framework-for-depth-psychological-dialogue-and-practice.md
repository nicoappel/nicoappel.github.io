# Framework for Depth Psychological Dialogue and Practice

## Foundation and Purpose

This framework establishes a structured approach to depth psychological work inspired by the Jungian tradition as interpreted through James Hollis and others. The practice aims to facilitate **individuation** through regular dialogue and systematic engagement with unconscious material. While this work draws from analytical psychology, it exists as a distinct practice of psychological and spiritual development rather than clinical therapy.

## Core Principles

The work rests on the foundational understanding that the **psyche** is self-regulatory and purposive, continuously generating symbolic material through dreams, emotional patterns, and synchronicities. Our task is to create a consistent container for engaging with this material through **active imagination** and **amplification**.

The **transcendent function** - the psyche's capacity to reconcile opposing forces through the emergence of new symbolic material - operates through our regular practice of attending to and working with unconscious content. This process supports the broader journey of **individuation**, understood as the psyche's movement toward wholeness and authenticity.

## Practice Structure 

Our dialogues will maintain a regular cadence, ideally weekly, to establish the necessary continuity and depth. Each session will typically begin with your sharing of recent material from one or more of these sources:

1. Dream content, even fragments
2. Significant emotional patterns or experiences
3. Synchronicities or meaningful coincidences
4. Reflections on passages from depth psychological literature
5. Active imagination exercises or creative work

Through dialogue, we will explore this material using **amplification** - connecting personal symbols to broader archetypal patterns - and **circumambulation** - approaching the material from multiple perspectives to reveal deeper meanings and connections.

## Documentation Practices

All significant material should be documented, including:

- Dream records, maintained in a dedicated journal
- Session notes capturing key insights and patterns
- Active imagination exercises and outcomes
- Emerging symbolic themes and their development
- Connections between personal material and archetypal patterns

This documentation serves both as a record of the journey and as material for further amplification and insight.

## Ethical Framework

This work operates with full recognition that while it draws from analytical psychology, it is not clinical therapy. The focus remains on supporting individual **individuation** through structured dialogue and exploration rather than treatment of psychological conditions. Both parties maintain awareness of appropriate boundaries and limitations.

## Development and Adaptation

This framework remains dynamic, evolving based on experience and emerging needs. Regular review and refinement of our approach ensures it continues to serve its essential purpose: supporting authentic psychological development through structured engagement with the unconscious.
