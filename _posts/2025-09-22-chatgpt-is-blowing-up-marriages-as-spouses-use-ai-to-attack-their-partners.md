Who would have thunk?

Seriously, the shocker here is that ChatGPT (standing in for all AI here) gets so much, or any, agency in the headline. That’s a fatal and widespread misconception. But it plays into some people’s hands. 

Secondly, consider how much authority people give ““the oracle”, completely ignoring its sycophantic pattern-matching next token prediction. 

That’s what really going haywire.
