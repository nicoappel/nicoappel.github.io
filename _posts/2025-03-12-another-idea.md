Current hero and role model: [Marc Rebillet](https://marcrebillet.com/) aka Loop Daddy.

As a reminder for myself, hereâ€™s a part of the lyrics from Marcâ€™s song _Another Idea_:

> When you can't come up with another idea, fuck it, dude
>
> Just make something
>
> Just get up, get in front of your shit, pump it out, baby
>
> No one gives a fuck about your creative integrity, none of it matters
>
> All that matters is that you're here, working
>
> Making shit, yeah, huh
>
> Go ahead and make that shit baby, go
