Refreshing read.

> Computation is physical
> 
> A key problem with ideas, particularly those coming from the Bay Area, is that they often live entirely in the idea space. Most people who think about AGI, superintelligence, scaling laws, and hardware improvements treat these concepts as abstract ideas that can be discussed like philosophical thought experiments. In fact, a lot of the thinking about superintelligence and AGI comes from Oxford-style philosophy. Oxford, the birthplace of effective altruism, mixed with the rationality culture from the Bay Area, gave rise to a strong distortion of how to clearly think about certain ideas. All of this sits on one fundamental misunderstanding of AI and scaling: computation is physical.
