title: "ChatGPT is Bullshit"

I read Frankfurter’s essay more than once (credit to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/29/on-bullshit) for the recommendation).

It was relevant in 2016, and is even more relevant today. Whether it pertains to a US president, or to LLMs, the distinction between lying and bullshitting is essential:

> Persons who communicate bullshit are not interested in whether what they say is true or false, only in its suitability for their purpose. _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit)_

Now we have to extend “persons” to LLMs. And this is why some folks have expanded on this and published a paper:

🔗 [ChatGPT is bullshit](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5)

If you understand the technology and its flaws, the best explanation and excuse might be, quoting [Frankfurter](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7759033M/On_Bullshit) directly:

> It is impossible to lie without knowing the truth.

LLMs don’t know the truth. They are made of inert weights, reacting to input. Hence, they bullshit.
