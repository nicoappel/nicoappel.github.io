Update your local dictionary. We have a new word: AI workslop. 

![Workslop](/assets/images/workslop.png)

> On social media, which is increasingly clogged with low-quality AI-generated posts, this content is often referred to as "AI slop." In the context of work, we refer to this phenomenon as "[workslop](https://www.betterup.com/workslop)." We define workslop as *AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task*.
