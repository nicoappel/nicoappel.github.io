I grew up on Nirvana and Rage Against The Machine. Naturally, I was motivated to learn to play the guitar, and also to wear some of grandparent's clothes (thrifting, sort of).

While the former turned out great, the latter thankfully happened during a time when people did not have camera phones. The creation of evidence was mostly avoided. 

By the way, that concert doesn't end well. Still aches me to see this.
