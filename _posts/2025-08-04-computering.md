**com·put·er·ing** `|` / kəm-ˈpyü-tə-riŋ /

*noun*

**Definition of computering**

**1:** the ritualistic practice of occupying a laptop-equipped station in a café, coworking facility, or similar public venue while engaging in ostensibly productive digital activities

**2:** a form of **cargo cult** behavior characterized by the faithful reproduction of professional computing environments without necessarily possessing coherent objectives or methodological frameworks

**3:** the performative act of appearing professionally engaged through the deployment of technological apparatus and accompanying behaviors (typing, clicking, message verification) irrespective of actual productive output

**4:** a cultural practice intrinsic to **digital nomadism** and **location-independent** work arrangements, particularly concentrated in remote destinations favored by freelance practitioners and entrepreneurial aspirants

## Etymology

*Early 21st century (circa 2003): blend of* **computer** *and the suffix* **\-ing**, *suggesting ongoing activity; conceptually related to* **cargo cult** *practices wherein superficial behaviors are adopted in expectation of desired outcomes. Initially observed concurrent with widespread WiFi deployment and the emergence of laptop-centric work practices in urban café environments.*

## Usage

Predominantly manifested within the **digital nomad** ecosystem across remote locations including Bali, Thailand, Mexico, and similar destinations where **location-independent** professionals congregate. **Computering** practitioners establish temporary workstations equipped with laptops, noise-canceling headphones, and caffeinated beverages while engaging in characteristic behaviors.

The phenomenon encompasses legitimate productive digital work alongside pseudo-productive activities that simulate professional engagement. Practitioners frequently alternate between actual tasks and aimless browsing, email monitoring, or social media consumption while maintaining external appearances of focused concentration. **Casual networking** emerges as a secondary function, with practitioners engaging in spontaneous professional connections and informal knowledge exchange within these shared environments.

A significant component involves classic **bikeshedding** discussions concerning optimal equipment configurations, **biohacking** methodologies, **nootropic** supplementation protocols, and various **cognitive enhancement** strategies. These conversations often consume disproportionate attention relative to their practical utility, exemplifying **Parkinson's Law of Triviality** wherein peripheral concerns receive excessive focus while core productive activities remain neglected. This behavior pattern overlaps significantly with **cyberloafing** research, where ostensible work activities mask non-productive internet consumption.

**Computering** represents a contemporary manifestation of **presenteeism** adapted to the **gig economy** and **remote work**paradigms, where visual signifiers of productivity often supersede measurable output metrics within distributed professional networks.
