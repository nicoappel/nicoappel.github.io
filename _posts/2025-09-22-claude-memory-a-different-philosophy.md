This is fascinating. Anthropicâ€™s approach is so much better in my opinion. 

When I first learned about how ChatGPT creates and manages memories, I was not only disappointed, but also found the implementation to be lazy and way too opaque for the user. 

I have other gripes with Anthropic, mostly their excessive anthropomorphizing, but this is another plus point on my scorecard for Claude. A big one. 

> ChatGPT's hundreds of millions of weekly active users come from all backgroundsâ€”students, parents, hobbyistsâ€”who just want a product that works and remembers them without thinking about the mechanics. Every memory component loads automatically, creating instant personalization with zero wait time. The system builds detailed user profiles, learning preferences and patterns that could eventually power targeted features or monetization. It's the classic consumer tech playbook: make it magical, make it sticky, figure out different ways to monetize later.

> Claude's users represent a different demographic entirely. Anthropic's more technical users inherently understand how LLMs work. They're comfortable with explicit control at every level. Just as they choose when to trigger web search or enable extended thinking, they decide when memory is worth invoking. They understand that memory calls add latency, but they make that tradeoff deliberately. Memory becomes just another tool in their arsenal, not an always-on feature. This audience doesn't need or want extensive profilingâ€”they need a powerful, predictable tool for professional work. Not to mention, they're also more privacy-conscious.
