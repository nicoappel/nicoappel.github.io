The nerdy version. Because I have a draft for another article [over there](https://nicoappel.substack.com/) in which I’m making an effort to keep it all very simple.

But this here… we can talk shop.

Let’s start with the core tool right away: I am typing this in SilverBullet,

> … a note-taking application optimized for people with a [hacker mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker). […] Where your notes essentially become a _database_ that you can query; that you can build custom knowledge applications on top of? A _hackable notebook_, if you will?

SilverBullet reminds me of Roam Research, which I used for a while. Compared to Notion, SilverBullet is only local plain text files, formatted in Markdown. Running Silverbullet in a Docker container locally on my Mac is a bit of a stretch for me. I’ve done things like that, but I only understand a very small part of what’s actually going on. However, this is 2025 and I have a few very knowledgeable friends that never sleep. I can ask for help and get some pretty solid advice whenever I am lost.

You’ll be reading this on a blog that is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages. I set this up just the other day. I had some one-digit percentage of the necessary knowledge/experience. Again, I had some help. Apparently, we got it done. Amazing. Still blows my mind 🤯.

At its core, I think, **personal knowledge management** based on [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (I also like [Andy Matuschak’s Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX), or more modern and digital take) has three components:

1. Creating notes
2. Making connections
3. Refining notes

There are _many ways_ to **create notes** in the first place. That’s probably the easiest part. Mostly, I suppose, it should be low friction. You can always edit your notes progressively.

As for **making connections**, this seems a cognitive and manual, or technical, process. You could get assistance from AI, but you probably want to stay in the loop. Otherwise, you miss out on the benefits, meaning:

> If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we’re thinking about. It creates pressure to think carefully about how ideas relate to each other. – [Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zF8xCU4BwXwbmSyp7tmff9i)


**Refining notes** requires significant cognitive effort. It is active learning.

Don’t miss this: it’s _personal_ knowledge management. You “write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience” ([Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9)).
