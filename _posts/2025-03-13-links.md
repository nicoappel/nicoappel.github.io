🔗 [How AI can make you a 10x professional](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-ai-can-make-you-a-10x-professional/)

Apart from how overused “10x” is, he’s has a point.

> …for many jobs that primarily involve applying knowledge or processing information, AI will be transformative. In a few roles, I’m starting to see tech-savvy individuals coordinate a suite of technology tools to do things differently and start to have, if not yet 10x impact, then easily 2x impact. I expect this gap to grow.


> I see more and more AI-native teams reinvent workflows and do things very differently.

→ I think the key phrase here is “reinvent”. Instead of just delegating, automating and scaling up existing workflows, the higher leverage is in deconstructing and reinventing. 

A more recent example of this, which is not so much intentionally designed but the result of different capabilities becoming available, is creating prototypes in one collaborative session (1-3 hours) instead of weeks of iterations. These disruptions are not going to be prevented.
