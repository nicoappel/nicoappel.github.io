Not only too big to fail, but too deep into impossible to keep promises.

Early on, while there was less information, experience, even research, it was tough to argue against wild speculations (hype). Times have changed. For those actively using and following the technology, nothing but a moderate view seems at all reasonable. 

I still feel like some of the people working at the "labs" are so inundated or immersed, maybe they are truthful but starkly mistaken. They should be smarter than that. The other explanation is that they are bullshitting and lying, misrepresenting. 

Hating to be or become more cynical, I'm making a similar error of not following Occam's razor. Maybe greed is all that's needed to explain this.
