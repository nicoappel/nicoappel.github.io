Oh, this one is great!

Checkout the podcast version, a "4-parter", which is ongoing as I type this. Personally, I am already looking forward to part 3.

I have a weakness for people who are making sense and providing well-researched information with an attitude and some cursing. Bonus points for hearing them say "mate", and not "dude" or "bro".

Fantastic material.
