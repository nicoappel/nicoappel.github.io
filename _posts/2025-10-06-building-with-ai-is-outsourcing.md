If you're building things with AI (LLMs and inference), you have to realize that this is simply a new, or more modern, form of outsourcing.

It's about figuring out what needs to be done, breaking it down into workflows, writing up instructions, and then having _somebody else_ take care of that.

So in essence, it's just outsourcing, and the same problems that traditionally apply to outsourcing also apply here.

You have the classic problems: dependency, responsibility for the work, potential IP theft, and the need to keep on top of your providers.
