Makes sense. 

Seems _extremely_ idealistic and difficult to pull off. 

I'm wondering: 
- Do things like this have to take the form of "movements"?
- Is that organic, or a more effective way to communicate and spread an idea?
- Is it enough, too little, or too much scope for a tribe? Or a club?
- How many of such clubs/tribes/movements is one able to be part of and sustain? As in, how much care can I share, without getting spread too thin?
