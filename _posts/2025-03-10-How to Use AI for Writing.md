Based on the interview with Tyler Cowen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ztOoADp7M),
I wanted to extract and extend on some aspects Tyler brought up.

Tyler has been very bullish on AI, and for some reason has avoided having a debate
with Gary Marcus. I haven’t really looked deeper into that, but let me say that I side

AI in its “primitive” form (chatbots) is an immense tool.

How Cowen is using it – and his recommendations – make a lot of sense, and are highly
practical. He is a writer and an economist. Whether he’s the best person to judge the
intricate technical limitations of the technology, is another matter.

I fed Claude the full transcript and asked for a ”comprehensive breakdown” (you can
find the output I am using to write this [here](https://nicoappel.github.io/assets/docs/claude-output-tyler-cowen.md))

## Asking Better Questions

In my own work, I have made the same observation. Context is king.

Cowen doesn’t mention the way context is handled in Claude’s implementation of the projects feature.
I find this to be very useful. For my upcoming workshop in-person workshop here in Berlin, titled “Towards Chronic Health-
Building Your Personal Well-Being System with AI”, I will share some practical tips on creating and maintaining context
for an ongoing project.

## The Three Layers of Understanding AI

This is where we can see how Cowen is extrapolating from his own user experience, combined with
what he’s reading. He emphasizes that in order to understand AI, there are three layers:

1. **Access to the best systems**: Using premium models with the most advanced capabilities. This is nothing new. And it
