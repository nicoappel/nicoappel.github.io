Based on the interview with Tyler Cowen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ztOoADp7M),
I wanted to extract and extend on some aspects Tyler brought up.

Tyler has been very bullish on AI, and for some reason has avoided having a debate
with Gary Marcus. I haven’t really looked deeper into that, but let me say that I side
with Cowen’s enthussiasm in this particular context: For the curious, learning-oriented knowledge workers,
AI in its “primitive” form (chatbots) is an immense tool.

How Cowen is using it – and his recommendations – make a lot of sense, and are highly
practical. He is a writer and an economist. Whether he’s the best person to judge the
intricate technical limitations of the technology, is another matter.

I fed Claude the full transcript and asked for a ”comprehensive breakdown” (you can
find the output I am using to write this [here](assets/docs/claude-output-tyler-cowen.md))
