Fascinating and beautiful. [Max Richter composed a full eight and a half hour album to listen to while you sleep. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(album))

As you can imagine, most of the music and sounds are pretty serene.

But it gets better: there is a free [iPad app](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/sleep-by-max-richter/id1509084936?l=en-GB) which you can also run on your Mac (if it’s an Apple Silicon one). The app is connects to Apple Music or Spotify, then lets you choose between three modes: 

- Sleep
- Meditate
- Focus

I am using the **Focus** mode to listen to high-quality instrumental ambient music while I work or read. 

You can set a duration, basically a timer, and the app auto-selects tracks. I can’t really tell how much that varies yet. But the point is that all I have to do is set the duration and hit play.

You also get a nicely done animation to go along with it![[blog/_posts/sleep-app-max-richter.png]]
