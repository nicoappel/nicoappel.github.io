> The [Wikimedia Foundation](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/10/17/new-user-trends-on-wikipedia/) says page views have dropped by about eight percent compared to last year. The foundation points to generative AI tools and social networks that display Wikipedia content [without sending users to the site](https://the-decoder.com/pew-finds-that-only-1-percent-of-users-click-a-source-link-directly-from-googles-ai-overviews/). Bots that increasingly resemble real users are also putting more strain on Wikipedia's infrastructure.

World's most valuable data. The closest thing to a common, more or less global, understanding we have.
