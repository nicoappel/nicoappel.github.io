One of the problems with newsletters is that they are covering the latest product/software releases, developments, trends, what have you. 

Hence, everything is more or less a regurgitation of a press release. It maybe also be “first impressions”, or some initial test of any thing. There is not much substance. Technical specs, dimensions, version numbers, and similar metrics dominate. 

Beyond newsletters though, we have cultivated this race to immediate coverage. However, the cases where this is actually useful are rare. Gossip probably being a more legitimate use case for immediate coverage.

## Oldletters 

What I want are some “oldletters“.

They would cover things only after thorough testing, meaning real experience gained by using X _over time_. A couple of weeks, or a couple of months of usage is what my gut tells me should be about right. 

Come to think of it, this category exists, and I have seen it on YouTube with titles such as “6 Months With the …“ (which then is naturally followed by “… – I wasn’t expecting this” 🤦)

I’m more thinking of: 

- What happened to X?
- What became of Y?
- X after the dust has settled

Reviews where there is sufficient time in the “Re” to allow for a more balanced perspective and different kinds of insights.
