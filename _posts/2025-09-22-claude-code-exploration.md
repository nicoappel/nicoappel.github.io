I have been on the Claude Code train for the past few weeks, and it is still intensifying. 

I am collecting and testing various resources, and, of course, also creating my own. So there should be something to share in the near future. 

Working with an agent, and comparing that to what I was doing with the chatbot UI and some additional context engineering and customization (Claude projects and styles), I am feeling the difference. It took me a bit to get used to doing more work in the Terminal, and re-familiarizing myself with version control and git commands.

My latest toy is [happy](https://happy.engineering) which allows you to use Claude Code from your phone and puts a voice assistant as an intermediary on top of it all. It's nuts.
