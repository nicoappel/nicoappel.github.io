ðŸ”— [How YOU can change the world through WRITING with Alan Moore](https://youtu.be/oXr4sWVSbz0?si=La10lfmUL9L9j5G0)

> Now, to a writer, will is the single most important element because if you do not have will, then you might have the best ideas in the world. You might have a wonderful idea for a novel, and you will get perhaps two chapters in before you have an even better idea for another story. So, you abandon the novel, perhaps you'll get back to it, perhaps you won't, but you move on to your next great idea, you perhaps get a chapter into that. You can very easily, without the application of will, you can end up after 30 years as a writer having nothing but a stack of uncompleted manuscripts that you never finished. The important thing about will is if you focus that upon your imagination, you can actually bring things into materialization where they exist in the real world, where the rest of us exist, and where the rest of us can read them.

Darn! How do you know me so well?
