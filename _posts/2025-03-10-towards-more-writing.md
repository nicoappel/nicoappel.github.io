Getting the juices flowing.

I’ve been inspired by a couple of people recently. All of them are prolific, a quality – or maybe rather habit and skill – that I want to develop for myself more.

On a related note: it’s so good to have heroes, role models, or simply people you look up. I don’t feel like I managed to ever really acquire a mentor in any formal or informal way. But at least I can pick myself some heroes. _You_ might be one of them.
