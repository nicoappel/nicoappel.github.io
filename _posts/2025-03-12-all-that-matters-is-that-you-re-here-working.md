Current hero and role model: [Marc Rebillet](https://marcrebillet.com/) aka Loop Daddy.

As a reminder for myself, here’s a part of the lyrics from Marc’s song _Another Idea_:

> When you can't come up with another idea, fuck it, dude
>
> Just make something
>
> Just get up, get in front of your shit, pump it out, baby
>
> No one gives a fuck about your creative integrity, none of it matters
>
> All that matters is that you're here, working
>
> Making shit, yeah, huh
>
> Go ahead and make that shit baby, go

I guess **“heroic”** and **“pathetic”** are about as close as **“genius”** and **“delusional.”** Even those considered heroes and geniuses must maintain that conviction themselves, which I assume is fragile. That might be why arrogance or megalomania could help sustain the self-delusion, justified or not.

Bottom line: being able to trust one’s own judgment (internal and self-referential) against the majority view of others (external) is tricky.
