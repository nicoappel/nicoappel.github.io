ðŸ”— [OpenAI's Studio Ghibli meme factory is an insult to art itself](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/openais-studio-ghibli-meme-factory)

Brian Merchantâ€™s writing is a general recommendation. 

My comment on one side-aspect of this particular topic:

â†’ I am not yet as old as Miyazaki is in the clip, which itself is 8 years old. But what I know by now, intuitively, is that there is something that comes with life experience that we simply didnâ€™t have access to when we are younger. It doesnâ€™t really seem to be fully transmittable either. The perspective and attitude that we have when weâ€™re younger are great in many ways. But to inject or combine it with the wisdom of just having seen and experienced things seems very difficult.
