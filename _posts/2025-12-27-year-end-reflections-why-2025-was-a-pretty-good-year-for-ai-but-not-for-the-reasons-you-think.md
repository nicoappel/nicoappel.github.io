> What gives me hope is that the slop isn't inevitable, and we humans have a pretty reliable history of finding great works (like Shakespeare) out of the sea of slop we ourselves have written. Good stuff rises to the top.

> When you build actual systems—when there's discipline around what gets generated and how it gets checked before it goes out—you can produce work that's dramatically better than what most humans produce unassisted. I've seen marketing copy that people actually click on, emails that get responses, ad creative that outperforms what teams were producing manually. The difference isn't the model; it's everything around the model. Retrieval to ground the claims. Validation to catch the errors. Human checkpoints for edge cases. Taste applied at some point in the process.

> Is the content information-dense? Is it something you can come back to? Does it respect your time? Those are the right questions, and AI can help you answer them well—if you build the systems to make it happen rather than just connecting a model to a publish button and hoping for the best.
