Those who use a clipboard manager, and those who donâ€™t.

Strong passwords are a requirement not only for professionals, but for anyone doing anything online. While this has gotten better on the OS-level, I really would rather not know how the actual adoption rates are.

The clipboard manager is not as crucial, since it is not security and privacy related, but I can hardly see how anyone would be able to do any serious computering (yes, that is or should be a word) without being able to add multiple items to the clipboard and retrieving them. It is so basic and yet to high leverage. Many other tricks only become possible with this.

There are plenty of solutions. I used to use Alfred (mega supporter license), but switched to Raycast (free seems sufficient) since about one year ago.
