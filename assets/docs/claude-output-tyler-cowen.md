# Tyler Cowen on AI: Practical Usage for Reading, Writing, and Thinking

This analysis covers the key insights from Tyler Cowen's conversation with David Perell about practical applications of AI, particularly for writing, reading, and thinking. Cowen offers a unique perspective as someone knowledgeable about both AI and writing.

## How Tyler Uses AI in His Daily Work

### AI as the New Secondary Literature
Cowen primarily uses AI when reading, treating it as **secondary literature**. Rather than purchasing numerous books for research, he now buys fewer and uses AI to develop contextual understanding:

> "Most of all, I use AI when I read things. I use it as the secondary literature. So I'm preparing a podcast for a British historian... Now, maybe I've ordered and paid for two or three books on those kings, but I'll keep on interrogating the best LLMs about the topics of her books."

He actively engages with AI while reading classics like Shakespeare's Richard II or Wuthering Heights, asking questions like:
- "What do you think of chapter two?"
- "What happened there?"
- "What are some puzzles?"
- "What should I ponder more?"
- "How does that connect to something else later in the book?"

This approach creates a more active, enriched reading experience that improves his comprehension and retention.

### AI for Writing (Limited Usage)
Cowen doesn't directly use AI for his writing, with some exceptions:
- Getting legal or specialized background on unfamiliar topics
- Testing how readers might perceive his work (based on Agnes Callard's suggestion)
- Checking for potentially offensive content

He values maintaining his distinctive writing voice: "I want the writing to be my own; it's like my little baby... I want to be like Tyler Cowen, this weirdo."

### AI for Travel
Cowen finds AI exceptionally useful for travel:
- Identifying birds and plants through photos
- Understanding foreign menus
- Planning travel itineraries
- Finding recommended activities and restaurants
- Getting practical information about unfamiliar places

### AI in the Classroom
In his PhD classes, Cowen requires students to:
- Subscribe to premium AI services instead of purchasing textbooks
- Use AI in writing their papers
- Report on how they used AI (for his own learning)

He sees this as preparing students for the inevitable integration of AI in professional work.

## Tyler's AI Toolkit (The Models He Uses)

Cowen has developed specific use cases for different AI models:

**01 Pro (OpenAI):**
- His most frequently used model
- Best for specific queries and interactive dialogue
- Excellent for reading assistance

**Deep Research (from OpenAI):**
- "The single most impressive thing humans have built"
- Best for comprehensive reports
- Uses 03 model but with different functionality
- Will replace more human labor than other tools

**Claude:**
- "Thoughtful, philosophical, dreamy, flexible, and versatile"
- The best writer among AI models
- Good at creating visualizations and graphs

**DeepSeek (from China):**
- More creative, emotional, and romantic than other models
- Less constrained and "bland" than Western models
- Better at poetry and emotional content
- Hallucinates more often (less reliable for facts)
- Nicknamed "China Boss" by Cowen for its distinctive style

**Gemini (Google):**
- Best for working with longer documents
- Strong multimodal capabilities (especially with YouTube videos)
- Excellent for legal work and document analysis

**Perplexity:**
- Replaces most Google searches
- Up-to-date information with source citations
- Less prone to hallucinations due to web grounding

## The Future of Writing in an AI World

### What Writing Will Persist
Cowen believes certain types of writing will remain valuable despite AI advancement:

1. **Memoirs and personal experience**: "Writing memoirs, of course, the AI cannot do."
2. **Biographies** requiring interviews and fieldwork
3. **Highly personalized writing** that readers want from specific human authors
4. **Writing with distinctive, personal style** that readers value

He suggests writers will need to personalize more and lean into their unique perspectives.

### What Will Be Replaced
Cowen predicts certain types of writing will become obsolete:
- Generic corporate writing
- Predictive books about the near future (too rapidly outdated)
- Secondary literature and analysis
- Factual reports and summaries

### The Autobiography Hack
Cowen shared an interesting strategy for his own "autobiography":
- Instead of writing a full autobiography, he's writing targeted blog posts about periods of his life not covered elsewhere
- This will allow future AIs to compile a comprehensive biography based on his extensive public writings plus these additional pieces
- "It's so cheap to do the final mile on that."

## Learning Through AI

### Asking Better Questions
Cowen emphasizes the importance of specific, practical questions rather than broad queries:

> "They're asking it questions that are too general. They're not willing to put in enough of their own time generating context."

He recommends detailed first prompts followed by more specific follow-ups.

### The Three Layers of Understanding AI
Cowen outlines three levels of understanding AI:

1. **Access to the best systems**: Using premium models with the most advanced capabilities
2. **Understanding the rate of improvement**: Recognizing how reinforcement learning and other techniques enable continuous advancement
3. **Envisioning decentralized AI networks**: Understanding how AIs will develop their own "republic of science" with multiple agents interacting, correcting each other, and creating collective intelligence

## The Economic and Social Impact of AI

### The Rising Value of Secrets and Networks
In a world where public information is accessible to everyone through AI:

1. **Secrets become more valuable**: "Humans know secrets. Maybe AIs can be fed secrets, but they don't in general know secrets."
2. **Social networks increase in importance**: "Your network of humans is not just 20% more valuable. It could be 50x more valuable."
3. **In-person interactions gain value**: "Traveling and meeting people becomes way more important."

### Career Implications
Cowen suggests several shifts in career strategies:

- Get better mentors (more important than ever)
- Improve your peer network quality
- Recognize that traditional career paths are becoming less reliable
- Understand that PhD programs are riskier investments but potentially higher reward
- Learn to manage AI effectively while developing complementary human skills

## Practical Advice for Using AI

### Prompting Techniques
Cowen's approach to effective prompting:

- "Put humans out of your mind. Imagine yourself either speaking to an alien or maybe a non-human animal."
- Be more literal and specific
- For complex outputs, use Deep Research with detailed prompts
- Break complex queries into multiple interactions rather than one long prompt
- Use DeepSeek occasionally to avoid getting trapped in bland thinking

### Investment in Premium Models
Cowen strongly recommends paying for the best available models:

> "What is currently the best model as we are speaking is $200 a month. But unless you're very poor and have no prospects, I think that's a good investment for many, many more people than realize it."

He believes staying at the frontier of AI capabilities offers significant advantages, even as the technology rapidly evolves.

### Context Windows and Future Possibilities
On the potential of large context windows:
- Complete analysis of regulatory codes
- Processing historical archives and comprehensive datasets
- The future will involve massive human effort to convert existing knowledge into AI-usable forms

## Philosophical Perspectives

### AI's Impact on Human Knowledge
Cowen sees a future where our relationship with knowledge fundamentally changes:

> "AI, even in its most positive forms, has the potential to bring a lot of disruption and psychological disorientation, upsetting the balance of interest groups and social status."

He believes we're at the beginning of a revolutionary shift where machines will increasingly exceed human capabilities in various domains.

### Writing for the AIs
An intriguing concept Cowen discusses is "writing for the AIs" - creating content with the understanding that AI systems will be reading and indexing it:

> "When you write for the AIs, they're your most sympathetic reader. It's one reason to write for them. They're your best informed reader. You don't need to give them much background context."

This creates a new dynamic where writers might leave out explanatory context, knowing the AI can fill in the gaps.

## Conclusion: Cowen's Outlook

Cowen maintains a pragmatic stance toward AI advancement. Rather than focusing on dystopian or utopian scenarios, he emphasizes practical engagement:

> "If you want to make progress on thinking about the very big questions, simply using it, experimenting, seeing what works and fails, will get you much further than sitting on your duff and rereading Heidegger."

He views AI as both transformative and inevitable, requiring thoughtful adaptation rather than resistance. While acknowledging the psychological challenges of being "obsoleted" in certain domains, he focuses on finding new ways to add unique human value in an AI-rich world.
